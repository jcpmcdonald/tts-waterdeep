# Lords of Waterdeep implementation in Tabletop Simulator

## Getting Started
You need:
- Tabletop Simulator
- Atom
- Tabletop Simulator official plugin for Atom

Follow a guide to get Atom set up with Tabletop Simulator (I used this: http://blog.onelivesleft.com/2017/08/atom-tabletop-simulator-package.html)

### Installing

Put this repository into your "Base Path", as specified by your Atom plugin. The default base path is `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Tabletop Simulator`
Set the contents of your Global ttslua to something like:

```
#include Waterdeep/Main
```

Being sure to include any intermediate folders you may have.

Have Atom open, load any save file in Tabletop Simulator, and hit Ctrl+Shift+s to load the code into Tabletop Simulator
